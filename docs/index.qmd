## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Project description

The goal is to analysis the WASH school facilities data in Malawi

## Import

```{r}
read_xlsx(here::here('data/raw/JMP-WASH-in-schools-2022-data-by-country.xlsx'))

```
